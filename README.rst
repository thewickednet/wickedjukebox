Wicked Jukebox Development Repository
=====================================

The development repository is split into two main (master) branches:

- frontend

- backend

``frontend`` contains the primary user interface of the application, whereas
``backend`` contains the main code for the background service.

The ``master`` branch should only contain this README.

The split of the old ``master`` branch makes deployment on the server easier!
