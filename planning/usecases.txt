==============================================================================
[1] - A playlist created from a filter rule cannot contain real song entries
[2] - The [[Librarian]] will automatically search folder contents and/or
      web services for cover art. Entries it finds get stored as suggestions
      until a user says it's OK. An album can have multiple entries as cover
      art. If none is selected as favourite, a random choice is displayed.
[3] - This activity needs a separate permission
