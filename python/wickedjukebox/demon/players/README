This folder contains interfaces to various audio-player backends.
The files are loaded according to the "backend" parameter in the "channel"
settings.

If the "backend" variable is set to "fubar", the system tries to load
"fubar.py" in this folder.

Required methods are outlined in the "skeleton.py" file.
